# CS422-Project

  - Project Background and Problem Statement
  Each of us has our own unique handwriting, with some writing in large and loose strokes, while others are compact and meticulous. These seemingly simple handwritten features are actually closely related to our personality traits. The goal of this project is to explore whether a person's handwriting can reflect their personality traits
  To this end, we attempt to build a machine learning model that takes in a person's handwritten features (such as pen pressure, letter size, spacing, etc.) and predicts their scores in the five dimensions of the Big Five personality traits: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism.
